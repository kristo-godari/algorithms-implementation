# Algorithms Implementation

## Introduction
During my studies of algorithms, I recognized the importance of practical application through exercises and ongoing practice. 
In response, I began curating a repository of the algorithms I had learned. 
Though some of these algorithms were developed quite some time ago and remain in their raw state, I aspire to refine and enhance them through refactoring while augmenting their accompanying documentation.

## Algorithm List
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Graph cycle detection
- Graph topological order
- SHA-1(Secure Hash Algorithm 1) hash function
